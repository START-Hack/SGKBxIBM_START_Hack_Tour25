## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
__What is the current problem?__
- Users have limited insight into their spending and no tools to detect patterns in their spending history.

__What is the expected final product?__
Development of a prototype UI for an AI Finance Manager
- Automatically categorizes bank transactions (e.g. “groceries”, “transport”, “leisure”). 
- Automatically recognizes retailer logos and assigns them to transactions – even without a provided logo database; the use of external APIs/services (ideally free of charge) is explicitly permitted. 
- Provides conversational interface or pre-defined question & answer buttons
- Possibly: Provides visuals on the spending patterns and derives insights and develops proposals
- Possibly: Exports the results as a file (CSV/Excel) and provides an inference output point (API/endpoint) that can be integrated into the banking architecture.
