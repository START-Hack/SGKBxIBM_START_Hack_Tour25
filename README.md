<p align="center"> Personal Financial Management (PFM): Categorisation & enrichment of expenses using GenAI </p>

# <p align="center"> Who are we? </p>

St.Galler Kantonalbank (SGKB) is a Swiss universal bank based in the canton of St. Gallen, founded in 1868 to promote the regional economy. 

Our focus is on retail, corporate, and private banking solutions, with expertise in mortgages, SME financing, and wealth management.
We offer a full range of financial services and focuses on the core markets of Eastern and German-speaking Switzerland, as well as Germany.

Together with IBM, we aim to explore how GenAI can enhance the financial well-being of our clients.

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
__What is the current problem?__
- Users have limited insight into their spending and no tools to detect patterns in their spending history.

__What is the expected final product?__

Development of a prototype UI for an AI Finance Manager
- Automatically categorizes bank transactions (e.g. “groceries”, “transport”, “leisure”). 
- Automatically recognizes retailer logos and assigns them to transactions – even without a provided logo database; the use of external APIs/services (ideally free of charge) is explicitly permitted. 
- Provides conversational interface or pre-defined question & answer buttons
- Possibly: Provides visuals on the spending patterns and derives insights and develops proposals
- Possibly: Exports the results as a file (CSV/Excel) and provides an inference output point (API/endpoint) that can be integrated into the banking architecture.
